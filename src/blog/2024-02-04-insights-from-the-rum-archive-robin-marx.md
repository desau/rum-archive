title: Insights from the RUM Archive
date: 2024-02-04
description: In this talk, we first discuss how the RUM Archive works underneath; the data it holds and some examples on how to extract it yourself. We then move to analyzing some of the data contained within, looking at differences between for example browsers, operating systems and devices, and how those can impact performance metrics. We also discuss RUM-specific challenges, such as dealing with bias and noise in the measurements, and show how this can make a big difference in the conclusions we draw from the data.
