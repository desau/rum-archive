## Latest mPulse RUM Data Loaded

We've completed an export of mPulse daily RUM data into the BigQuery [`akamai-mpulse-rumarchive`](/datasets/#akamai-mpulse-rum) project up through 2023-10-31.

This brings the RUM Archive's [mPulse dataset](/datasets/#akamai-mpulse-rum) to a running total of 425 straight days of data available since 2022-09-01.  (There is also first-of-month data going back to 2021-10-01).

## One Year Anniversary!
